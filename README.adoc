= Plug

== Building

==== Linux and Mac

For Unix-based operating systems, you should run the following commands:

[source, shell]
----
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
rustup update stable
cargo install --git https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-gc
----

You will also need to install the following packages:

 - Linux:
[source, shell]
sudo apt install cmake pkg-config libssl-dev git clang libclang-dev

 - Mac:
[source, shell]
brew install cmake pkg-config openssl git llvm

==== Windows

If you are trying to set up Plug on Windows, you should do the following:

1. First, you will need to download and install "Build Tools for Visual Studio:"

    * You can get it at this link: https://aka.ms/buildtools
    * Run the installation file: `vs_buildtools.exe`
    * Please ensure the Windows 10 SDK component is included when installing the Visual C++ Build Tools.

    * Restart your computer.

2. Next, you need to install Rust:

    * Detailed instructions are provided by the https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installing-rustup-on-windows[Rust Book].
        * Download from: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
        * Run the installation file: `rustup-init.exe`
        > Note that it should not prompt you to install vs_buildtools since you did it in step 1.
        * Choose "Default Installation."
        * To get started, you need Cargo's bin directory (%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin) in your PATH environment variable. Future applications will automatically have the correct environment, but you may need to restart your current shell.

3. Then, you will need to run some commands in CMD to set up your Wasm Build Environment:

	rustup update nightly
	rustup update stable
	rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly

4. Next, you install wasm-gc, which is used to slim down Wasm files:

	cargo install --git https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-gc --force

5. Then, you need to install LLVM: https://releases.llvm.org/download.html

6. Next, you need to install OpenSSL, which we will do with `vcpkg`:

	mkdir \Tools
	cd \Tools
	git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
	cd vcpkg
	.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
	.\vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows-static

7. After, you need to add OpenSSL to your System Variables:

	$env:OPENSSL_DIR = 'C:\Tools\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows-static'
	$env:OPENSSL_STATIC = 'Yes'
	[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OPENSSL_DIR', $env:OPENSSL_DIR, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
	[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OPENSSL_STATIC', $env:OPENSSL_STATIC, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)

8. Finally, you need to install `cmake`: https://cmake.org/download/

==== Shared Steps

Then, grab the Plug source code:

[source, shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:cennznet/plug-blockchain.git
cd plug-blockchain
----

Then build the code:

[source, shell]
----
cargo build                 # Builds all native code
----

You can run all the tests if you like:

[source, shell]
cargo test --all

Or just run the tests of a specific package (i.e. `cargo test -p srml-assets`)

You can start a development chain with:

[source, shell]
cargo run \-- --dev

Detailed logs may be shown by running the node with the following environment variables set: `RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run \-- --dev`.

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action locally, then you can create a local testnet with two validator nodes for Alice and Bob, who are the initial authorities of the genesis chain specification that have been endowed with a testnet DOTs. We'll give each node a name and expose them so they are listed on link:https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#/Local%20Testnet[Telemetry] . You'll need two terminals windows open.

We'll start Alice's plug node first on default TCP port 30333 with her chain database stored locally at `/tmp/alice`. The Bootnode ID of her node is `QmQZ8TjTqeDj3ciwr93EJ95hxfDsb9pEYDizUAbWpigtQN`, which is generated from the `--node-key` value that we specify below:

[source, shell]
cargo run --release \-- \
  --base-path /tmp/alice \
  --chain=local \
  --alice \
  --node-key 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 \
  --telemetry-url ws://telemetry.polkadot.io:1024 \
  --validator

In the second terminal, we'll run the following to start Bob's plug node on a different TCP port of 30334, and with his chain database stored locally at `/tmp/bob`. We'll specify a value for the `--bootnodes` option that will connect his node to Alice's Bootnode ID on TCP port 30333:

[source, shell]
cargo run --release \-- \
  --base-path /tmp/bob \
  --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/QmRpheLN4JWdAnY7HGJfWFNbfkQCb6tFf4vvA6hgjMZKrR \
  --chain=local \
  --bob \
  --port 30334 \
  --telemetry-url ws://telemetry.polkadot.io:1024 \
  --validator

Additional Plug CLI usage options are available and may be shown by running `cargo run \-- --help`.
